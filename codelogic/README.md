# Financial Dictionary App

A comprehensive Flutter application that provides quick access to financial terms and definitions. This app serves as a digital financial dictionary, helping users understand complex financial concepts with ease.

## 📱 What This App Does

This is a **Financial Definition Lookup App** that allows users to:

- **Bookmark Feature**: Save important terms for quick reference (placeholder functionality)

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### **MVVM Architecture**
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern for clean separation of concerns:

- **Models** (`models/story_model.dart`): Data structures for financial terms
- **Views** (`views/`): UI components and pages
- **ViewModels** (`viewmodels/definition_lookup.dart`): Business logic and state management
- **Widgets** (`widgets/`): Reusable UI components

### **State Management**
- Uses **Provider** for state management
- Implements **ChangeNotifier** pattern for reactive UI updates
- Real-time search filtering without performance issues

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Data Loading & Error Handling**
   - Loads 300+ terms from JSON asset file
   - Graceful error handling with retry functionality
   - Loading states with progress indicators

2. **Advanced Search Functionality**
